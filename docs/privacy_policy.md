# SleepyBaby Privacy Policy

Last updated: 19 September 2025

SleepyBaby (“the App”) is published by Alexandru-Cristian Pana (“we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App.

Summary: Audio stays on your device and preferences are stored locally. In production builds we use Google Firebase services (Analytics, Crashlytics, Performance Monitoring) to collect limited usage and diagnostic information to improve the App. We do not sell your personal information.

## 1. Information We Collect

The App does not create user accounts and does not collect raw audio or personal recordings. In production builds, we collect limited analytics and diagnostic data via Firebase services, as described below.

### Microphone (on‑device only)
- SleepyBaby uses the microphone solely to detect crying patterns and to play soothing sounds.  
- Audio is processed entirely on your device.  
- Raw audio is not uploaded or stored on our servers.

### Local preferences and recordings
- App settings (e.g., brightness level, target volume, tutorial completion) are saved only on your device using Android’s local storage mechanisms.  
- If you create a custom “shush” recording, it is saved locally on your device and remains under your control.  
- Uninstalling the App or clearing its storage removes these items from your device.

## 2. Data Sharing

We do not sell your data. We share limited analytics, crash, and performance information with our service provider Google Firebase, which processes data on our behalf to provide analytics and diagnostics. No other third parties receive your information.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

- Audio input and “shush” recordings remain on your device. We do not upload or store them on our servers.  
- Preferences are stored locally on your device.  
- Firebase may retain analytics, crash, and performance data per Google’s retention schedules (for example, Analytics data is commonly retained up to 14 months). We do not store independent copies of these reports outside Firebase.  
- You can delete local App data at any time by clearing the App’s storage or uninstalling the App. To request deletion of analytics or crash data associated with your device, contact us and we will work with Firebase to honor the request where technically feasible.

Note: If your device or operating system performs backups (e.g., Google device backup) copies of app data may be included in your personal backup under your account, according to your device settings. We do not control or access such backups.

## 4. Security

Because data stays on your device, please keep your device secure (screen lock, OS updates). We do not receive or store your data on our servers.

## 5. Children’s Privacy

SleepyBaby assists parents and caregivers. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. As we do not collect data, there is no personal information for us to delete; removing the App or clearing its data removes local information stored by the App on the device.

## 6. International Transfers

Firebase may process analytics, crash, and performance data on servers located outside your country of residence. These transfers are governed by Google’s data protection terms and safeguards.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

If we change how the App handles information, we will update this document and the “Last updated” date. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.

### Diagnostics and analytics (production builds)
- We use Google Firebase Analytics to record basic, pseudonymous usage events that help us understand how the App is used (e.g., starting/stopping monitoring, permission prompts, tutorial actions, preview play/stop). These events may include timestamps, app version, device model, operating system version, and locale.  
- We use Firebase Crashlytics to receive crash reports and non‑fatal error logs containing stack traces and device state at the time of the error (e.g., OS version, app version).  
- We use Firebase Performance Monitoring to measure performance (e.g., durations of key operations we trace inside the app) to diagnose slow paths and improve reliability.  
- In debug builds, Analytics, Crashlytics, and Performance Monitoring are disabled by default.
